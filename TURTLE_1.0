This is Turtle, a simple MUD client designed for Discworld MUD (but hopefully also useful for other
MUDs).

This is version 1.0.  It offers:
* a very basic client with a somewhat clever input window (that stores history), a scrollable
  output window, and a single connection accessed through the #connect <host> <port> command.
* telnet support
* ansi, xterm256 and xterm16m colour support

Future development will explore many more features.
